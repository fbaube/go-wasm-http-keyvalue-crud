# KV works; RDBMS RSN 

This repo makes fixes to WasmCloud's
[example](https://github.com/wasmCloud/go/tree/main/examples/component/http-keyvalue-crud)
( described
[here](https://wasmcloud.com/blog/2025-01-23-walkthrough-a-wasmclod-crud-application-in-go/)
) so that it actually works.

**The intent is to get this to also use SQLite.**

This "early" version works with `wasm-tools` version 1.225.0.
It does **not** work with `wasm-tools` version 1.227.0, and
the cause looks pretty much impossible to sort out.

It remains to be seen whether it works with `wash up -d`.
Note the comment down below: <br/>
*When running this example with the `wash dev` command, wasmCloud uses
its included NATS key-value store to back key-value operations, but the
app could use another store like Redis with no change to the Go code.*

WasmCloud's original version is several directory levels down,
but ths repo works fine in isolation, cloned from git to any
location. (This is not true for some other demos they have.) 

The router has to be passed to `wasi-http`, which chokes on the
new Go `ServeMux`, so we use a third-party router instead.

To exercise this example when running `wash dev`:
```
wash app list
curl -X POST localhost:8000/crud/mario -d '{"itsa": "me", "woo": "hoo"}'
curl localhost:8000/crud/mario
curl -X DELETE localhost:8000/crud/mario
```

# Problems at runtime

If NATS is not running in the background, you will see this:
```
2025-03-16T17:00:30.605287Z ERROR wasmcloud_provider_keyvalue_nats: Failed to connect to NATS: timed out
2025-03-16T17:00:30.605339Z  WARN wasmcloud_provider_sdk::provider: receiving link failed error=failed to connect to NATS
```

This warning appears several times:
``
2025-03-16T17:00:37.406283Z  WARN wasmcloud_runtime::component: exported component resources are not supported in wasmCloud runtime and will be ignored, use a provider instead to enable this functionality
```

# Go HTTP Key-Value CRUD

This example is a WebAssembly component that demonstrates simple
CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) with the
[`wasi:keyvalue/store`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-keyvalue) interface. 

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

> [!WARNING]
> Due to incompatibilities introduced in `wasm-tools` v1.226.0, a version 
> of `wasm-tools` <= 1.225.0 is **required** for running this example.
>
> You can install `wasm-tools` [v1.225.0 from upstream releases](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/releases/tag/v1.225.0), or use
> `cargo` ([Rust toolchain](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)) -- (i.e. `cargo install --locked wasm-tools@1.225.0`)

Before starting, you need to have installed
[`tinygo`](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install/),
[`wasm-tools`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools#installation),
wasmCloud Shell [`wash`](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/installation).

## ðŸ‘Ÿ Run the example

In addition to the standard elements of a Go project, the
directory includes the following files and directories:

- `/build`: Target directory for compiled `.wasm` binaries
- `/gen`: Target directory for Go bindings of
[interfaces](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/concepts/interfaces)
- `/wit`: Directory for WIT packages that define interfaces
- `bindings.wadge.go`: Automatically generated test bindings
- `wadm.yaml`: Declarative app manifest
- `wasmcloud.lock`: Automatically generated lockfile for WIT packages
- `wasmcloud.toml`: Configuration file for a wasmCloud app

### Start a local development loop

Run `wash dev` to start a local development loop:

```shell
wash dev
```

The `wash dev` command will:

- Start a local wasmCloud environment
- Build this component
- Deploy your app and all dependencies to run the app locally
- Watch your code for changes and re-deploy when necessary.

### Clean up

You can stop the `wash dev` process with `Ctrl-C`.

When running this example with the `wash dev` command, wasmCloud uses
its included NATS key-value store to back key-value operations, but the
app could use another store like Redis with no change to the Go code.
